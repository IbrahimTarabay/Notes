<title>How to understand arguments</title>
</head><body><b>Why Arguments Matter<br/>
<br/>
</b>--&gt;People don't want to be arbitary or have unjustified beliefs, they want to have reasons for what they think and do<br/>
<br/>
--&gt;Arguments are just ways to express reasons, and if you can understand arguments, you can understand reasons and if you can formulate good arguments you can have good reasons<br/>
<br/>
--&gt;another way to understand arguments is to avoid mistakes because some people are going to try to convince you to think the way they want you to think and to behave the way they want you to behave by giving you bad arguments<br/>

An argument may have one reason or multiple reasons to be strong.<br/>
</span></div></span><span style="font-size: 13pt"><div style="text-align: left"><span style="font-family: arial">-------------------------------------------------------------<br/>
<b>What is an argument?<br/>
<br/>
</b>--&gt;you can't win an argument just by yelling at someone<br/>
<br/>
--&gt;you cannot win an argument simply by calling your opponent a stupid git<br/>
<br/>
--&gt;also complaining can't win argument because they're just expressing your emotion about the situation<br/>
<br/>
--&gt;argument is an intellectual process, it's a process not just of asserting your views, but of giving some kind of reasons for your views<br/>
<br/>
--&gt;An argument is a connected series of statements [intended] to establish a definite proposition or to reason why the proposition is true<br/>
-----------------------------------------------------------<br/>
<b>What are arguments used for? justification<br/>
<br/>
</b><b>Persuading</b>--&gt;is making people believe or do something that they would not otherwise believe or do<br/>
<br/>
<b>Justifying</b>--&gt;is showing someone a reason to believe the conclusion<br/>
<br/>
<b>Questions to Ask:<br/>
<br/>
</b>1- is the arguer trying to change someone's mind? --&gt;if so, the purpose is persuasion<br/>
<br/>
2-is the arguer trying to give some kind of reason to believe something? --&gt;if so, the purpose is justification<br/>
-----------------------------------------------------------<br/>
<b>Strong arguments don't always persuade everyone<br/>
<br/>
</b>--&gt;It's not enough for an argument to be strong, valid and sound to be persuasive. you can have an argument for which every premise is genuinely true, and where every conceivable flaw in the argument is negated and still not have it be persuasive. there will almost always be someone who either misunderstands the argument, or who blindly believes the opposite of a premise in face of facts. Human beings aren't always logical and don't always believe scientifically proven cause and effect. religious and cultural beliefs can be too hard to overcome. even the best arguments can have disbelievers<br/>
-----------------------------------------------------------<br/>
<b>What Else are arguments used for? Explanation<br/>
<br/>
</b><b>Explaining</b>--&gt;is giving a reason why something happened (or why it is true)<br/>
<br/>
<b>Kinds of Explanations:<br/>
</b><br/>
1-<b>Causal--&gt; </b>tells you why something happened<br/>
<br/>
ex:<br/>
</span></div><div style="text-align: left"><span style="font-family: arial">why did the bridge collapse?</span></div>&nbsp;The earthquake shook it<br/>
<br/>
2-<b>Teleological</b>--&gt;it's looking at the purpose or the goal<br/>
<br/>
ex:<br/>
Why did Joe go to the grocery store? to buy milk<br/>
<br/>
3-<b>Formal<br/>
</b><br/>
ex:<br/>
Why doesn't this peg fit in that rount hole? the peg is square<br/>
<br/>
4-<b>Material<br/>
</b><br/>
ex:<br/>
</span><span style="font-size: 13pt">Why is this golf club light? it's made of graphite</span>&nbsp;<br/>
<br/>
<b>ex:<br/>
</b>Train whistle, why does train emit such a noise?<br/>
<br/>
1-causal: conductor pull a lever on the train, which creates that noise<br/>
<br/>
2-teleological: the train was crossing an intersection with cars<br/>
<br/>
3-formal: because the whistle on the top of the train has a certain shape that makes the air come out with a certain vibration <br/>
<br/>
4-material: because air has a certain density and certain material that makes it create that kind of sound <br/>
<br/>
<b>An Explanation in the form of an argument:<br/>
<br/>
</b>--&gt;When an object is freely suspended in a medium, and when the medium is more dense than the object, then the object rises.<br/>
<br/>
<b>ex:<br/>
</b>The helium balloon is less dense than the surrounding air--&gt;The helium balloon rises<br/>
<br/>
so:<br/>
<br/>
General principles or laws initial conditions--&gt;Phenomenon to be explained<br/>
<br/>
--&gt;Bode's law is an example, where you can get a prediction without explanation<br/>
<br/>
<b>Explanation</b>--&gt;an attempt to fit a particular phenomenon into a general pattern in order to increase understanding and remove bewilderment or surprise<br/>
<br/>
<b>Explanation</b>--&gt; is not persuasion or justification or generalization or prediction, those are purposes of argument<br/>
-----------------------------------------------------------<br/>
<b>What are arguments made of? language<br/>
<br/>
Purposes of Argument:<br/>
</b><br/>
1-Persuasion<br/>
2-Justification<br/>
3-Explanation<br/>
<br/>
--&gt;other animals cannot use language that's complex enough to make arguments<br/>
<br/>
--&gt;if other animals can use language, we can't define humans, as the animal that talks but we can define humans as the animal that argues, humans are the only one that argues and reasons in this sense<br/>
<br/>
<b>Language is:<br/>
<br/>
</b>1-Important<br/>
2-Conventional<br/>
3-Representational<br/>
4-Social<br/>
<br/>
<b>Meaning is use</b>--&gt;if you want to understand the meaning of the word like: "hello" you don't look for some object that it referes to, you ask how is it used<br/>
<br/>
<b>Linguistic-Speech-Conversational<br/>
<br/>
</b><b>Linguistic</b>--&gt;to utter a series of words that are meaningful together.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Speech</b>--&gt;A speech act occurs even if the intended effect doesn't occur <b>ex: </b>to say "I am sorry" is to apologize to someone even if that person doesn't forgive you.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Conversational</b>--&gt;is the bringing about of an effect <b>ex: </b>to alert someone to a danger is to make that person aware of that danger.</body></html>
