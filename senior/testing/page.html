<title>Testing</title>
</head><body>--&gt;Bugs cost companies a lot of money<br/>
<br/>
--&gt;Any serious company is going to have tests<br/>
<br/>
<b>TDD--&gt;</b>test driven development, you actually write test before write your application code.<br/>
--------------------------------------------------------------<br/>
<br/>
<b>Unit Tests</b>--&gt;test individual functions or classes<br/>
<br/>
<b>Integration Tests</b>--&gt;This is testing how different pieces of code work together so it can be testing of whether the database works with express app that's requesting some data<br/>
<br/>
<b>Automation Tests</b>--&gt;UI tests, This usually involves testing real life scenarios on the browser by making sure that the expected behavior on the web is correct, it's simulation of user behavior in browser like clicking,typing,scrolling<br/>
-----------------------------------------------------------<br/>
<b>Note</b>--&gt; we install : npm install node-fetch to use fetch method in node because fetch method only exist in the browser<br/>
-----------------------------------------------------------<br/>
<b>Enzyme</b>--&gt;it's standard library for test react components<br/>
<br/>
with enzyme 90% we use shallow<br/>
<br/>
<b>shallow rendering</b>--&gt;mean render just component not also other components inside that component, ideally you want to test one thing at a time without affecting all the child components<br/>
<br/>
<b>mount</b>--&gt;does full DOM rendering, maybe component has some sort of a lifecycle method<br/>
<br/>
render--&gt;it doesn't actually need a full DOM API but it does render any of its core or any child component<br/>
