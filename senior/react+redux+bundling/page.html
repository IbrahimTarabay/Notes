</head><body><b>Angular vs React vs Vue<br/>
<br/>
</b>--&gt;All of them with the goal of managing large applications on the front-end that have a lot of javascript<br/>
<br/>
--&gt;if i was working for large bank with massive codebase i would pick angular Because angular is a framework which means it's an entire kitchen<br/>
<br/>
--&gt;I would pick React if i work for a company with strong developer team and that also needs to be flexible and evolve by adding different libraries and tools to the ecosystem<br/>
<br/>
--&gt;i would pick Vue if we want a simple way of writing code that is friendly, it might be easier to pick up if you hire a lot of junior developers<br/>

----------------------------------------------------------<br/>
<b>Scripts</b>--&gt;that we provided in package.json, instead of us installing webpack and babel and we sometimes also use browserify to bundle with javascript, react-scripts does everything for you<br/>
<br/>
<b>"eject"</b>--&gt;you can customize react-scripts and go on your own so as your project gets bigger and bigger you can always eject and customize your app<br/>
<br/>
<b>package-lock.json</b>--&gt;automatically generated by package.json<br/>
<br/>
<b>manifest.json--&gt;b</b>it's new feature that allows people to download a shortcut to your website and have an icon on their desktop<br/>
<br/>
--&gt;it's good to update your libraries but it's not necessarily always the best way to do things because you might have those rare cases when bugs emerge<br/>
<br/>
<b>serviceWorker</b>--&gt;something allow us to do something called PWA<br/>
<br/>
<b>ReactDOM</b>--&gt;used for dom for web<br/>
<br/>
<b>export default</b>--&gt;Mean export one thing or one component<br/>
<br/>
One thing you will notice with React is that because we always have to return just one element from a component, we end up wrapping a lot of our components in <br/>
<br/>
<b>You are right! React realized this was an issue, and with the newer version of React 16.2, they introduced something called Fragment to fix this issue.</b>&nbsp; <br/>
----------------------------------------------------------<br/>
<br/>
<b>State</b>--&gt;is simply an object that describe your application<br/>
<br/>
<b>Hooks</b>--&gt;a way for us to avoid classes so that we can avoid the super keyword, "this" keyword even componentDidMount() or lifecycle hooks that sometimes can get confusing so hooks allow us to use functional components<br/>
<br/>
--&gt;<b>Best resource is usually the documentation</b><br/>
<br/>
--&gt;idea of hooks isn't javascript concept it doesn't really exist in the javascript world, Hooks are very react specific so there is a bit of magic that's happening.<br/>
<br/>
--&gt;Hooks work side-by-side with existing code so you can adopt, there are no plans to remove classes from react<br/>
<br/>
--&gt;Only call hooks at the top level don't call hooks inside loops, conditions or nested functions<br/>
<br/>
--&gt;Only call hooks from react functions, don't call hooks from regular javascript functions<br/>
--------------------------------------------------------<br/>
<b>State management<br/>
<br/>
</b>--&gt;when react app gets bigger and bigger we can have massive states in components so keeping track of all this state is really hard so we need some form of a state management<br/>
<br/>
Redux solves this problem for us, what if we just remove all the state what if we just have props and now the state we keep it in store <br/>
--------------------------------------------------------<br/>
<b>Redux 3 principles<br/>
<br/>
</b>1-Single source of truth<br/>
2-State is read only (instead we would create a new state after each action is taken by the user)<br/>
3-Changes using pure functions<br/>
--------------------------------------------------------<br/>
<b>Four main ideas about webpack<br/>
<br/>
</b>1-Entry(usually your javascript file)<br/>
2-Output(Where should we get back all these files)<br/>
3-loaders(are tools that compile or transpile your code so you send your code and it use something like babel to transpile ex: ES6 to ES5)<br/>
4-plugins<br/>
