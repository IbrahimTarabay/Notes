</head><body><b>Angular vs React vs Vue<br/>
<br/>
</b>--&gt;All of them with the goal of managing large applications on the front-end that have a lot of javascript<br/>
<br/>
--&gt;if i was working for large bank with massive codebase i would pick angular Because angular is a framework which means it's an entire kitchen<br/>
<br/>
--&gt;I would pick React if i work for a company with strong developer team and that also needs to be flexible and evolve by adding different libraries and tools to the ecosystem<br/>
<br/>
--&gt;i would pick Vue if we want a simple way of writing code that is friendly, it might be easier to pick up if you hire a lot of junior developers<br/>
