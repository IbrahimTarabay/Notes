</head><body><b>Angular vs React vs Vue<br/>
<br/>
</b>--&gt;All of them with the goal of managing large applications on the front-end that have a lot of javascript<br/>
<br/>
--&gt;if i was working for large bank with massive codebase i would pick angular Because angular is a framework which means it's an entire kitchen<br/>
<br/>
--&gt;I would pick React if i work for a company with strong developer team and that also needs to be flexible and evolve by adding different libraries and tools to the ecosystem<br/>
<br/>
--&gt;i would pick Vue if we want a simple way of writing code that is friendly, it might be easier to pick up if you hire a lot of junior developers<br/>

<b>Scripts</b>--&gt;that we provided in package.json, instead of us installing webpack and babel and we sometimes also use browserify to bundle with javascript, react-scripts does everything for you<br/>
<br/>
<b>"eject"</b>--&gt;you can customize react-scripts and go on your own so as your project gets bigger and bigger you can always eject and customize your app<br/>
<br/>
<b>package-lock.json</b>--&gt;automatically generated by package.json<br/>
<br/>
<b>manifest.json--&gt;b</b>it's new feature that allows people to download a shortcut to your website and have an icon on their desktop<br/>
<br/>
--&gt;it's good to update your libraries but it's not necessarily always the best way to do things because you might have those rare cases when bugs emerge<br/>
<br/>
<b>serviceWorker</b>--&gt;something allow us to do something called PWA<br/>
<br/>
<b>ReactDOM</b>--&gt;used for dom for web<br/>
<br/>
<b>export default</b>--&gt;Mean export one thing or one component<br/>
<br/>
One thing you will notice with React is that because we always have to return just one element from a component, we end up wrapping a lot of our components in <br/>
<br/>
<b>You are right! React realized this was an issue, and with the newer version of React 16.2, they introduced something called Fragment to fix this issue.</b>&nbsp; <br/>

<br/>
<b>State</b>--&gt;is simply an object that describe your application</body></html>
