--&gt;This model worked pretty well when there were only a few big websites, After all, if you were an advertiser around the year 2000 and you bought ads on yahoo,AOL,msn, you would reach most of the online population, However some years later with search engines making it easier for people to find other websites and with an explosion of content online it became harder for advertisers to reach their audiences, and since there was now much more inventory available to buy the publishers had a harder time selling all of their advertising space<br/>

<br/>
--&gt;A new model started to emerge, Ad networks came to the scene, Ad networks bundled inventory from many different small sites who did not really have sales teams to sell advertising themselves, advertisers could then go to these networks and buy through them, Ad networks really served as a middleman<br/>

<br/>
--&gt;in the meantime, Google and Yahoo pioneered sponsored advertising in search, the search ads we talked about them, what it was really different about these search ads is that they were bought and sold automatically through an auction that seemed a lot more efficient than buying and selling advertising over the phone or in person, that's also when advertising exchanges started to emerge in<br/>
