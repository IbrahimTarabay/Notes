<title>How Do Display Ads Work?</title>
</head><body>--&gt;cnn.com or blog like dog woof basically starts with a blank canvas, The publisher then publishes content on that website and they do that by using content servers, usually they use an application called a content management system CMS<br/>
<br/>
--&gt;There's a separate mechanism that makes the advertising appear on the site, the ad server, the publisher will assign some spaces in the website but it would like to serve ads and ad server will go to work to get these spaces filled up with ads, actually there are typically two ad servers involved in making an ad appear on the website (Publisher ad server-Advertiser ad server)<br/>
<br/>
--&gt;The publisher's ad server will recognize the assigned space for an ad and it will connect with the advertiser's ad server where the creator for the ad is waiting for its chance to be served<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
--&gt;Now, here is what happens when a user accesses a page on a website,The publisher's content server will first make the content appear for the user and then the publisher's ad server activates to fill up the empty ad spaces on the page<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
--&gt;The data that can be collected and saved in the online environment are really what makes display advertising uniquely powerful, so where do these data play a role and how do they appear?<br/>
Ans: at the point when the user starts interacting with a website data come into play as soon as a user arrives on the publisher's website the publisher will send some data to the user's browser that data gets stored in the browser and it records what page the user is looking at, the publisher also checks in the user's browsers to see whether it can find some previously stored data there that tells the publisher something about the user<br/>
<br/>
<img src="data and display.png" /><br/>
<br/>
--&gt;The data the publisher was able to collect about the user then gets passed along to the ad server of the publisher, the ad server will then use this information about a user to figure out which ad out of all the advertising deals it has made may be the best fit for this user, then when it made that decision it passes the request on to the ad server of the advertiser and it also passes on some data it had gathered about the user, Both ad servers will also send a little bit of information back to the user's browser, This helps to remind them later which ads the user saw<img src="publisher.png" /><br/>
<br/>
<b>So what is digital data really?<br/>
<br/>
</b>at its core, the data is pieces of text that are saved in the servers, the content server or the ad server The piece of text records information for every interaction of the server with the user that interaction is sometimes referred to as a server hit, the record which have information about interaction kept in the log file<br/>
<br/>
<img src="log file.png" /><br/>
<br/>
--&gt;these log files are kept on the server they're the basis for web measurement tools as they hold the information that can help the publisher understand how many times a page was seen, which pieces of content are the most popular<br/>
<br/>
--&gt;There is another way of saving information, it's the data stored in the form of a browser cookie, cookies are not too dissimilar from the log files, they are also a piece of text with information about the interaction between the user and the servers, but this time the information is stored in the browser of the user<br/>
<br/>
<img src="cookie.png" /><br/>
<br/>
<b>Cookie</b>--&gt;Text file stored in the user's browser<br/>
<br/>
<b>Setting a cookie</b>--&gt;which is act of storing this text file in the user's browser<br/>
<br/>
<b>Calling a cookie</b>--&gt;when the publisher accesses this file later on<br/>
<br/>
--&gt;This is how we can keep track of which user does what on the website<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
--&gt;other parties that are interested in setting cookies on the user's browser since the user does not know what agreements are in place the cookies set by other parties than the publisher itselfs are considered third party cookies<br/>
<br/>
<b>Third party cookies</b>--&gt;often belong to organizations that focus on collecting and connecting data about users browsing across different websites that data is very valuable to both advertisers and publishers<br/>
<br/>
ex:<br/>
users come to food.com to look for recipes, food.com can place a cookie on the user's browser and collect information on the types of recipes a user seems to like but food.com really doesn't know much else about its users than their food preferences, if food.com allows a third party to place a cookie, the third party can track behavior on food.com as well as other websites it has similar deal with for instance, it may collect data on style and fashion websites, travel websites etc<br/>
<br/>
<img src="third party cookie.png" /><br/>
<br/>
--&gt;Now the third party cookie allows food.com to link its first party user cookie to the third party cookie revealing all kinds of information about its users based on their behavior on other websites that allows food.com to attract a broader range of advertisers for instance, advertisers who are interested in targeting women interested in a family trip to mexico, the third party cookie because it sees browsing behavior outside of food.com can make this connection<br/>

<b><span style="font-size: 13pt">T<div style="text-align: left"><span style="font-family: Open Sans">here is an increasing amount of online content consumption that happens on mobile platforms outside the browser, but in mobile applications or apps. So, if cookies don’t work for apps, how do publishers keep track of behavior on the apps</span></div></span></b>&nbsp; <br/>
<br/>
Tracking using Advertising IDs<br/>
<span style="font-size: 16pt"><span style="font-family: Open Sans"><div style="text-align: left">The different mobile operating systems have a special way for advertisers to track information through the device ID for advertisers. It is a unique code per device that holds information advertisers can use to understand a user’s behavior.<br/>
</div></span></span><br/>
<span style="font-size: 16pt"><span style="font-family: Open Sans"><div style="text-align: left">In iOS, the operating system for Apple devices, this is referred to as <b>IDFA (ID for advertisers)</b> and in Google’s Android it is the <b>Android Advertiser ID.</b><br/>
</div></span></span><br/>
<span style="font-size: 16pt"><span style="font-family: Open Sans"><div style="text-align: left">You can actually check out the information in the IDs yourself to see what is stored there. Users can also ‘reset’ the ID, which is comparable to ‘clearing cookies’ - making the system forget what was stored.<br/>
</div></span></span>&nbsp; <br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-size: 16pt"><span style="font-family: Open Sans"><div style="text-align: left">Since all publishers see a lot more of their traffic go through mobile platforms, they all work hard to try to get users to log in when consuming their content on mobile apps.<br/>
Once a user logs in, the publisher has a new way to connect all the dots through the log-in ID.<br/>
</div></span></span><br/>
<span style="font-size: 16pt"><span style="font-family: Open Sans"><div style="text-align: left">Right now, both Google and Facebook are very strong at using their login ID to connect behavior across platforms. Since users use products of their platforms that require login, like messenger and email on mobile phone and desktop, Google and Facebook can more easily connect behavior on mobile with behavior on the desktop than other publishers can.<br/>
</div></span></span>--------------------------------------------------------------<br/>
--&gt;As users navigate online an increasing amount of data is generated, users leave a data trail behind and every user builds out its online use of DNA= a stream of data that captures information on who the user is?, what does the user like?, which pages has the user visited in the past?<br/>
<br/>
<img src="dna.png" /><br/>
<br/>
--&gt;some of that data is stored in the registration information where users tell publisher something about themselves<br/>
