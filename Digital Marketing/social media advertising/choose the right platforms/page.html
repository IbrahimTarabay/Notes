</b><b>What ad types does Facebook offer?</b><br/>
<div style="text-align: left"><span style="font-family: Open Sans"><span style="font-size: 13pt">We can classify Facebook’s ad options based on what the ads look like and what objectives they have<br/>

<b>What Facebook ads look like<br/>
</b><br/>
<div style="text-align: left"><span style="font-family: Open Sans"><span style="font-size: 13pt">Here you have four different choices – you can create an ad that features a single image, a single video, or multiple images that are displayed either in a carousel format or as a slideshow<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

<div style="text-align: left"><span style="font-family: Open Sans"><span style="font-size: 13pt">Facebook also offers a new, more immersive ad experience on mobile. They call it Facebook Canvas. Canvas looks like a normal mobile news feed ad, but once a user taps to open the ad, he or she is taken to a full screen experience (videos, images, text, products) that the advertiser can customize. To learn more about Facebook Canvas, go to</span><span style="font-size: 16pt"> </span></span></div><a href="http://canvas.facebook.com/">canvas.facebook.com</a><br/>
<br/>
<b>What objectives can I meet with my Facebook ads?</b><br/>
<div style="text-align: left"><span style="font-family: Open Sans"><span style="font-size: 13pt">You can optimize ads on Facebook based on what specific objective your campaign has. Generally, Facebook distinguishes three different kinds of objectives that follow the traditional user journey from awareness to conversion:</span><span style="font-size: 16pt"><br/>
</span></span></div><ul><li><b>Raising awareness</b>: This includes campaigns to raise brand awareness, local awareness and to maximize reach.</li>
<li><b>Consideration</b>: These are ads that drive traffic to your website, boost the engagement of your posts, increase app downloads or video views and help you collect customer data (leads) to use in follow-up campaigns.</li>
<li><b>Conversion</b>: These are ads that increase the conversion on your website or online shop, advertise specific products to users who have interacted with your shop before, or get people to visit your local store.</li>
</ul>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: left"><span style="font-family: Open Sans"><span style="font-size: 13pt">Note that conversion campaign objectives require you to add a few lines of code to your website, which will then implement the Facebook pixel on your site. To learn how to create a Facebook pixel and how to add it to the code of your website,have a look <a href="https://www.facebook.com/business/help/952192354843755">here</a>. If you want to track the actions that happen inside your mobile app as a result of your ads, your developer should implement a piece of code called App Events. Point them to </span></span></div><a href="https://developers.facebook.com/docs/app-events">this site</a><span style="font-size: 13pt"><div style="text-align: left"><span style="font-size: 16pt"><span style="font-family: Open Sans"> </span></span><span style="font-family: Open Sans">to learn more<span style="font-size: 16pt">&nbsp; <br/>

<div style="text-align: left"><span style="font-family: Open Sans"><span style="font-size: 13pt">Based on past user behavior data, Facebook will show your ad to those people in your target audience who are most likely to perform the action you want them to.</span></span></div>&nbsp; <br/>

<br/>
Let’s say you decided to run an ad for <b>BambooHR</b> on <b>LinkedIn</b>. As you know, BambooHR is a software solution for small- and medium-sized companies to organize all their HR related information in one place. Their target customers are HR managers in small businesses and the product is for business usage, so LinkedIn seems to be the best platform to meet them. HR managers tend to be very active on LinkedIn, too, since it’s a great resource to recruit or research potential employees.<br/>
<br/>
To make sure you reach HR decision-makers in small businesses, you would make use of LinkedIn’s <b>‘Experience targeting’</b> to target people who work in a HR function in a company with less than 500 people. You might also use <b>‘Location targeting’</b> to focus only on users from the US, if this is the only market where BambooHR is currently available.<br/>
<br/>
On LinkedIn, it makes sense to book a <b>Sponsored Content</b> ad, because its placement on people’s newsfeeds gives you more space to talk about the product and it feels less promotional. It turns out BambooHR also has a pretty active company page on LinkedIn, so that’s a great place to link back to, and might also earn them some additional followers.<br/>
<br/>
In your ad, you could showcase the <b>short video</b> that BambooHR features on their website, which explains the product in 3 minutes. Your <b>ad copy</b> could say: “Find out why BambooHR is the No. 1 online HR software for small and medium businesses. Try us for free today, and free up time for meaningful work!”<br/>
<br/>
A click on the ad would bring the user directly to the free trial landing page, so BambooHR can collect the contact information of their potential customers.<br/>
