<b>--&gt;search engines believe that several links pointing to your site is similar to many people saying that you are important but the search engine will also evaluate whether those links that point to you from external websites are of high quality and coming from trustworthy, credible sites, so not every incoming link is considered equally valuable<br/>

<br/>
<b>Natural Links--&gt;</b>natural links are the links you do not have to ask for. they are naturally given to your website or page from external websites, natural links are gained when another website determines that they value your content or your product and they want to direct their own audience to that content<br/>
<br/>
<b>Manual Links--&gt;</b>are the links you gain by actively promoting your site and content, this is the process by which you manually contact a website or blogger to ask them for a backlink to your website or page<br/>
<br/>
--&gt;There are lots of tricks people try to create links for themselves, you should avoid these techniques as search engines will penalize your site if they detect these kinds of spammy links, using these sorts of tricks is called black hat practices<br/>
<br/>
<b>Black hat practices</b>--&gt;are strategies and techniques employed with the intention of deliberately "tricking" search engines<br/>

<b>Page Authority--&gt;</b>a score developed by Moz that predicts how well a specific page will rank on search engines<br/>

<b>Inbound Links--&gt;</b>Links from external sites that point to your site<br/>

--&gt;Social media links don't have the same weight as the links you get from other websites<br/>
<br/>
--&gt;<b>Google is not looking at the number of likes and shares on facebook or the number of tweets or retweets, they're looking at real engagement that happens and social media just happens to be a conduit for that engagement<br/>
