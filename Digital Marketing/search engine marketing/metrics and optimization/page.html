</head><body><b>Conversion Tracking</b>--&gt;it's a tool that shows you what happens after a customer clicks on your ads, whether they purchase a product, signed up for your newsletter or download your app, When we set up conversion tracking in AdWords you basically generate a specific code snippet that you add to your website or your mobile app code, when a customer now clicks on your search ad, Google places a temporary cookie on their device, if this customer now completes the action you defined as conversion the code snippet on your site tells AdWords about that action and the conversion is recorded<br/>
<br/>
--&gt;with the information we get from conversion tracking, these advertisers can calculate their return on investment with AdWords to make sure they're spending their money wisely<br/>
<br/>
<b>view-through conversions</b>--&gt;are conversions that happen after an impression of your ad<br/>

</span></span></div><br/>
<span style="font-size: 13pt"><br/>
1-Translate your Marketing Objective into your top KPI. Depending on what action (conversion) you want your potential customers to perform, this is the Cost per Acquisition (CPA), Cost per Subscriber or Lead (CPL) or if you ‘just’ want traffic Cost per Click (CPC)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
2-Your campaign ultimately is successful if you achieve your Marketing Objective at a cost below what you can afford to pay while keeping your desired level of profitability / ROI<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
3-The price per conversion (CPA/CPL) is driven by the conversion rate and the CPC<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
4-The conversion rate can be optimized by improving and testing the quality of your landing page and aligning it with your ads<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
5-The CPC can be optimized by improving the quality and relevance of your ads and landing page (Quality Score), which should in turn improve the CTR<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
6-You can also lower the CPC by bidding for relevant keywords with less competition<br/>
<br/>

The number of impressions and the average position your ads receive are indicators of your Ad Rank relative to the competition</span></body></html>
