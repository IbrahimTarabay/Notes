</head><body><b>Optimization Strategy</b><br/>
<br/>
1-Be specific and go long-tail<br/>
2-Pause keywords with low CTR<br/>
3-Use Match Types<br/>
4-Add Negative Keywords<br/>
5-Bundle closely related keywords in one Ad Group<br/>
----------------------------------------------------------<br/>
<b>Testing and Running Experiments<br/>
<br/>
</b>--&gt;To figure out what contributes to the success of an ad, you can run so-called "single variable A/B split tests" in other words, testing two ads that only differ in one variable(such as the headline, description or landing page) against each other. By running a single variable A/B split test, you can learn how a single variable influences the performance of the campaign and which iteration(A or B) is better<br/>
<br/>
<b>To set up a test, follow these steps:<br/>
<br/>
</b>1-Define one goal metric<br/>
2-Identify the element(s) of the ad you want to test<br/>
--&gt;elements that you can change:<br/>
-Headline<br/>
-Description<br/>
-Call to Action<br/>
-The promoted offer<br/>
-Landing Page<br/>
-URL Path<br/>
-Ad Extensions<br/>
-Ad Group Keywords<br/>
<br/>
3-Create the different version(s) of your ads/ad groups<br/>
4-Changing Ad Copy<br/>
5-Analyze your results<br/>
<br/>
ex:<br/>
<div style="text-align: left"><span style="font-family: Open Sans"><span style="font-size: 13pt">The team experimented with A/B tests and paused keywords that were not performing well to keep the Quality Score high. Building specific landing pages for both objectives as well as for desktop and mobile helped increase conversion. Ad extensions were used to increase the visibility of Alveoleâ€™s ads and especially ads with Sitelinks extensions generated high CTRs.</span></span></div>&nbsp; </body></html>
