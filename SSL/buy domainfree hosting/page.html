<br/>
--&gt;each domain has its owner and the owner of each domain is recorded in <b>WHOIS </b>database<br/>
<br/>
--&gt;Recommended to use <b>Private Profile</b><br/>
<br/>
--&gt;think twice before purchasing any additional service when you buy domain name because you probably you won't need at all<br/>
<br/>
<b>CAUTION</b>--&gt;Don't forget to renew domains you own before the expiration date because it might be registered by someone else, it's good practice to mark in the calendar date by which your domain will expire, usually domain registrars send emails notification emails about renewal but sometimes it doesn't happen<br/>
<br/>
after buying domain--&gt;go to admin panel--&gt;create password<br/>
