<br/>
<b>Increase in Accounts receivable</b>--&gt;mean that customer buying with credit card and doesn't receive cash yet<br/>
<br/>
<b>Increase in Accounts payable</b>--&gt;we bought a lot of supplies for our watches from company that makes really cool crystal and sapphire is watch face, but we haven't paid for yet<br/>
<br/>
--&gt;You want to pay you debt as late as you can as long as you don't pay interest expense and everybody else that does business with you they want to screw you, they want to pay you back as late as they can as long as they don't receive pay interest to us, that means if i pay everybody back a month later than i should without having a penalty that's an extra 1% benefit i get that month<br/>
