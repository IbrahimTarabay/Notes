<title>Delegating</title>
</head><body>--&gt;The most successful people in large and small companies delegate a lot<br/>
<br/>
--&gt;you can sweep the floor better than anyone on your team can, but does this mean that you should spend your time sweeping the floor? Don't be a perfectionist, as it hurts you professionally, it hurts your growth, delegate what you've already done well to others<br/>
<br/>
--&gt;Delegating is about trust and developing others, Delegating is an investment<br/>
<br/>
--&gt;What you shouldn't delegate? business+career-oriented items, high-level strategic planning<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Below is an excerpt of the 6 T’s of what to delegate from the aforementioned article:<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<b>"Tiny</b>: Tasks that are so small they seem inconsequential to tackle but they add up. They are never important or urgent, and even if they only take a few minutes they end up taking you out of the flow of more strategic work. For example, registering for a conference or event, adding it to your calendar, and booking the hotel and flight — on their own each of these things may not take much time, but taken together, they all add up.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Tedious</b>: Tasks that are relatively simple probably are not the best use of your time. Very straightforward tasks can (and should) be handled by anyone but you. For example, manually inputting a 100-item list into a spreadsheet and color-coding it, or updating the KPIs in your presentation deck.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Time-Consuming</b>: Tasks that, although they may be important and even somewhat complex, are time-consuming and do not require you to do the initial 80% of research. You can easily step in when the task is 80% complete and give approval, oversight and/or direction on next steps.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Teachable</b>: Tasks that, although complicated-seeming at first and possibly comprising several smaller subtasks, can be translated into a system and passed along, with you still providing quality checks and final approval. For example, teaching one of your direct reports how to draft the presentation deck for the monthly all-hands meeting, and even how to be the one to deliver those updates to the team.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Terrible At: </b>Tasks that not only do not fall into your strengths, but an area where you feel unequipped. You take far longer than people skilled in this area, and still produce a subpar result.  For example, the visual design of those PowerPoint slides for the team meeting, or even hiring a professional designer for an upcoming presentation outside of your organization such as an upcoming TEDx talk.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Time Sensitive:</b> Tasks that are time-sensitive but compete with other priorities; there isn’t enough time to do them all at once, so you delegate an important and time-sensitive task so that it can be done in parallel to your other project-based deadlines. For example,  leaving your iPad on the plane after a flight (as regretfully I recently did); working to recover it before it goes completely missing into the airport lost and found abyss by calling customer service daily (with long hold times). Calling an airline to change seat assignments for the following day while you are in all-day meetings."<br/>
