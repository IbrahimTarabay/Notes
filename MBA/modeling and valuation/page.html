<title>Modeling and Valuation</title>
</head><body>--&gt;The last thing you should do is speak to management why? Because they are incredible salespeople<br/>
<br/>
<b>What is investor relations?<br/>
<br/>
</b>--&gt;every investor have relations team in company he want to invest and their job to help you the investor to understand the company<br/>
<br/>
--&gt;at the end of your research process then pick up the phone if you're still confused and call investor relations department in company<br/>
<br/>
--&gt;Remeber you have the same access to inforamtion as wall street analysts:<br/>
1-www.sec.gov<br/>
2-investor relations website<br/>
<br/>
--&gt;modeling and valuation is very easy to do for public traded companies than private companies(because we don't know how to access their data)<br/>
----------------------------------------------------------<br/>
--&gt;Modeling is very easy it all comes down to 1 simple rules <b>everything is just percent of revenue </b>once you see what percent of revenue every line item is then you simply look for trends in the historical data then you make basic assumptions about the future(meaning what percent of sales each line item will be and why)<br/>
<br/>
--&gt;hardware is less profitable than software<br/>
<br/>
--&gt;satya nadella CEO of microsoft, he created the cloud division at microsoft, he build an amazing part called Azure and this the reason the board of directors selected him to be the next CEO after steve ballmer because he understands the cloud and cloud computing is much more profitable too<br/>
<br/>
--&gt;everyone has their own bias<br/>
<br/>
--&gt;you have the same info access as wall street analysts reg fd--&gt;after 2001 when a lot of people lost a lot of money investing in markets, the government created this so the average investors can get access to the exact same information at the exact same time as big mutul funds<br/>
----------------------------------------------------------<br/>
--&gt;Less is more the more complex you add to model the more chance you have of getting the wrong results<br/>
<br/>
<b>Valuation methodology:</b><br/>
<br/>
1-P/E = price/earnings(your target price should be based on estimates 5 year from now)<br/>
<br/>
2-P/R = price/sales(revenue)<br/>
<br/>
3-DFC<br/>

--&gt;Equity investors are better for startups because if you had debt investors and missed just one payment then your business dies, please register your company as an LLC(limited liability corporation) so can't come after your house if company failed<br/>
<br/>
<b>Raising money is tough. should you pay upfront fees to a consultant to raise you money?<br/>
<br/>
</b>99% of the time it's fraudulent or doesn't work<br/>
<br/>
--&gt;in real estate, commissions come after a sale and never before<br/>
<br/>
--&gt;commercial lenders want to see cash flow projections based on a few years of history, they care a bit less about the value of your assets unless they are extremely liquid<br/>
<br/>
--&gt;VC firms love risk, Debt firms hate risk</body></html>
