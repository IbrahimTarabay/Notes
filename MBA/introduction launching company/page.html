<b>How to start a Successful company</b><br/>
<br/>
</span>TAM--&gt;total addressable market<br/>
<br/>
--&gt;venture capitalists don't invest in companies less than TAM or the market size at least 20$ billion, because we want our underlying companies we invest in to get at least 5% market share longer term, 5% of 20$ billion is a billion dollars in revenue annually, so you want to invest in companies or start companies that have a massive total addressable market (TAM)<br/>
<br/>
google: your industry + TAM<br/>
<br/>
or pick the biggest 30 companies in your industry and add up the revenue from each of those 30 companies and that is close to TAM<br/>
<br/>
Note: you don't have to be a rocket scientist to start an internet company<br/>
<br/>
<b>Trends examples:</b><br/>
1-cloud(cost of set up company is very small, once you set it up you have access to billions of consumers on line)<br/>
<br/>
2-Construction or engineering market in the middle east<br/>
<br/>
3-security companies(there's going to be an incredible need for more private companies creating security products)<br/>
<br/>
4-IOT(that's a theme that has legs which will work for a long time for an investment)<br/>
<br/>
5-Hollywood(fiction in hollywood becomes reality most of the time, example: her movie, i think the next big operating system that matters will be voice based, so today apple is embracing this with siri which is getting better)<br/>
<br/>
--&gt;Ideas are commodities. execution is not (michael dell)<br/>
so you've to make sure that you have a great jockey because a horse is less relevant<br/>
<br/>
--&gt;the best technology company doesn't always win, the best marketing and sales team usually wins<br/>

<b>How to Network to get job or customer</b><br/>
<br/>
</span>--&gt;You all need to do at least one informational meeting per week<br/>
<br/>
Linkedin is useful for arrange a meeting we don't ever want to send e-mails to people we have never met before, we don't want to pick up the phone anymore and ask for help<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
--&gt;most people don't ask which is why they don't get what they want in life<br/>
<br/>
--&gt;you want to be fearful when others are greedy and greedy when others are fearful<br/>
<br/>
--&gt;if you're a contrarian in business and life, you'll be very successful in the long run<br/>
