<br/>
</b><b>Value investors</b>--&gt;meaning investors that like to get a dividend yield and buy stuff that's relatively cheap<br/>
<br/>
<b>Growth investors</b>--&gt;love companies that are growing very fast<br/>
<br/>
Garp investors--&gt;growth at a reasonable price<br/>
<br/>
<img src="value vs growth.png" /><br/>
<br/>
--&gt;at the end all growth investments become value investments<br/>

<br/>
--&gt;we will get average of those three to get target price<br/>
<br/>
v = (price/revenue+Discounted cash flow + price/earnings)/3<br/>
<br/>
--&gt;<div style="text-align: left"><span style="font-family: sf pro text"><span style="font-size: 13pt">We want to minimize the impact of a target price calculation that might be incorrect. Hence, using 3 or more valuation methodologies minimizes/normalizes the margin of error.</span></span></div>&nbsp; <br/>

<br/>
--&gt;so if you take the future cash that any company makes and discounted today that's the value the company<br/>

<b>Calculating the Terminal value<br/>
<br/>
</b><img src="terminal.png" /><b><br/>
</b><b><br/>
</b><b>--&gt;</b>the interest rate mentioned in this calculation is the interest rate for that particular company which is always larger than the government's interest rate<br/>

<b>valuation price/revenue<br/>
<br/>
</b><img src="price-revenue.png" /><b><br/>
</b><b><br/>
</b><b>--&gt;</b>How should we value companies that are going public but are not yet profitable? there's no cashflow there's no earnings but they have revenue so the answer is <b>price/revenue</b>&nbsp;it's a great vauation technique when company not profitable<br/>
<br/>
--&gt;if you think logically about<b>&nbsp;price/revenue</b>&nbsp;it's really the same thing as markert <b>cap/revenue<br/>
</b><b><br/>
</b><b>--&gt;</b>go to finance.yahoo.com to get market cap and revenue of twitter and facebook<br/>
<br/>

--------------------------------------------------------------<br/>
<b>price/earnings<br/>
<br/>
</b>--&gt;price to earnings(P/E) is similar to price to revenue(P/R) except you factor in growth more often with P/E than you do with P/R<br/>
<br/>
--&gt;A company usually trades on a P/E basis inline with its earnings growth rate<br/>
<br/>
--&gt;for example, a company that has earnings growing at 20% per year likely trades at 20x's earnings<br/>
<br/>
--&gt;for example, a company that has earnings growing at 10% per year likely trades at 10x's earnings<br/>
<br/>
--&gt;The stock market usually trades around 15x's earnings as the average stock has earnings growing at 15%<br/>
<br/>
--&gt;if a company misses earnings estimates by 20% (for example), then the stock usually gaps down by 20% and vice versa<br/>
<br/>
--&gt;<b>Price/Earnings </b>is the same thing as <b>market capitalization / net income<br/>
</b><b><br/>
</b>--&gt;PEG ratios measure a P/E ratio relative to earnings growth, stocks are usually bargains below a PEG of 1 and expensive above a PEG of 2<br/>
<br/>
--&gt;A company that trades at 20x's P/E and has earnings growing at 20% trades at a PEG of 1x<br/>
<br/>
--&gt;a company that trades at 20x's P/E and has earnings growing at 40% trades at a PEG of 0.5x's and is often a bargain (good buy idea)<br/>
<br/>
--&gt;A company that trades at 20x's P/E and has earnings growing at 10% trades at a PEG of 2x is often too expensive and usually a sell or a short candidate for hedge funds<br/>

<b>Amazing formulas to assess financials<br/>
<br/>
</b><img src="formulas.png" /><b><br/>
</b><b><br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</b>--&gt;How profitable is a company for every dollar they sell of inventory before expenses?<br/>
&nbsp;Cost of Goods Sold/Revenue = Gross Margin<br/>
<br/>
--&gt;How profitable is a company for every dollar they sell of inventory after most expenses?<br/>
EBITDA/Revenue = Operating Margin<br/>
<br/>
--&gt;How profitable is a company for every dollar they sell of inventory after all expenses?<br/>
Net Income/Revenue = Net Profit Margin<br/>
<br/>
--&gt;How profitable is a company for every dollar they have of assets?<br/>
Net Income/Assets=Return on Assets<br/>
<br/>
--&gt;How profitable is a company for every dollar they have of equity?<br/>
Net Income/Equity=Return on Equity<br/>
<br/>
--&gt;these two formulas use income statement and balance sheet to assess profitability<br/>
1-Net Income/Assets=Return on Assets<br/>
2-Net Income/Equity=Return on Equity<br/>
<br/>
--&gt;<b>How do we know if a company has way too much debt?<br/>
</b><b><br/>
</b>1-Does the company have more debt than assets?<br/>
Total liabilities/Total Assets = Debt to Assets<br/>
<br/>
2-Does the company have more debt than equity?<br/>
Total liabilities/Total Equity = Debt to Equity<br/>
<br/>
3-Can a company pay the interest on its debt?<br/>
EBITDA/Interest = Interest Coverage Ratio<br/>
--&gt;last ratio should be bigger or you should be worry<br/>
<br/>
--&gt;<b>How long does it take a company to turn stuff they sell into$?</b><br/>
<br/>
1-How many days of inventory does a company have on hand?<br/>
(Inventory/Cost of Good Sold)*365 = Inventory Days on Hand<br/>
<br/>
<img src="formulas2.png" /><br/>
<br/>
Inventory=($1000 at year end/COGS was $100000 this year)*365 = 3.65 days of inventory days on hand<br/>
<br/>
--&gt;How is the company doing/valued versus the competition? it's tough to compare companies in different countries on all metrices<br/>
