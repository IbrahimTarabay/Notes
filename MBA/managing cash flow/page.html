<title>Managing Cash Flow</title>
</head><body><b>How do companies make budgets?<br/>
<br/>
</b>--&gt;Forecasting is not hard, All forecasts are based on percent of sales, Forecast sales and then the rest of the model is simple,Forecasts are never 100% accurate<br/>
<br/>
--&gt;Public companies forecast quarterly, start-ups forecast monthly, why? Because survival is the goal<br/>
<br/>
--&gt;All successful entities have budget forecasts<br/>
<br/>
--&gt;When you forecast you have to take into account seasonality, a lot of companies have their business pick up towards the end of the year(fiscal year)<br/>
<br/>
--&gt;You might one day work with people that lie about financials, please always be conservative and honest with forecasts<br/>
<br/>
<b>How can we measure how long it takes for assets and liabilities to turn into cash?<br/>
<br/>
</b>Ans: Cash conversion period ratios<br/>
<br/>
ex:<br/>
if we have 5000$ of inventory and the average daily COGS(cost of goods sold) is 100$ then we have 50 days of COGS in inventory<br/>
<br/>
another way to think about it is if we put another 1$ into inventory it won't be converted into cash(or COGS), inventory issues can destroy a company<br/>
<br/>
<b>Inventory to sale conversion period</b>&nbsp;= average inventories/COGS/365<br/>
<br/>
if we sell our product on credit can we track how long it takes us to collect cash?<br/>
<br/>
<b>Sale to cash conversion period =</b>&nbsp;<br/>
average receivables/sales/365<br/>
<br/>
<b>Purchase to payment conversion period =</b><br/>
average payables + average accrued liabilities/COGS/365</body></html>
