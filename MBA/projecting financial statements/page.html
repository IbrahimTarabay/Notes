<br/>
--&gt;Value investors usually only invest in companies that have very low price to earnings ratios<br/>
<br/>
--&gt;Don't ever talk behind somebody's back at work and even at home, it will ruin your attitude, you'll start getting very negative and you'll be less productive as a result, it's bad karma as well<br/>
<br/>
--&gt;face time matters, you want to be the first in and last out<br/>

<b>Due Diligence and Data Sources</b><br/>
<br/>
--&gt;Great financial analysts form their own opinions, other have hidden agendas, but most are wrong<br/>
<br/>
--&gt;when you watch media talk shows or investment shows you almost want to the opposite becasue they represent groupthink or what everybody is doing<br/>
<br/>
--&gt;Don't let others influence your opinion in finance<br/>
<br/>
--&gt;Question the financial data and form your own opinion<br/>
<br/>
