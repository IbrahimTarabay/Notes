<title>The Pillars</title>
</head><body><b>Everything is a game<br/>
<br/>
</b>--&gt;when we frame our mindset to think that everything is a game we inadvertently allow two things to happen in our lives<br/>
<br/>
1-<b>idea of a growth mindset</b>(is that we believe talent intelligence aren't just gifts that we're born with everything that you learn is trainable, with enough effort and strategy you can get better at anything)<br/>
<br/>
2-<b>locus of control</b>(to what degree people believe that they have control over outcomes and events in their lives)<br/>

<b>Feynman Technique<br/>
<br/>
</b>--&gt;if you want to really understand something well you need to be able to teach it explaining something in a simple way<br/>
---------------------------------------------------------<br/>
<b>Trunk Based Knowledge<br/>
<br/>
</b>--&gt;in order for us to be efficient learners to be successful learners to have successful careers we must first start from the roots from the trunk of the tree before we get to the leafs<br/>
---------------------------------------------------------<br/>
<b>Efficiency Trumps Grit<br/>
<br/>
</b>--&gt;The idea of being busy now is seen as a badge of honor in our society, being busy is a good thing but the truth is being busy just shows that you have lack of time management skills<br/>
<br/>
<b>Efficiency trumps grit</b>--&gt;if you use the right strategies you can get ahead of others<br/>
