</head><body><b>Learning vs Winning the system</b><br/>
<br/>
long term is a better strategy that winning the system and just trying to impress your boss or manager or friends<br/>
------------------------------------------------------------<br/>
<b>What is Success?<br/>
<br/>
</b>--&gt;Being smart is great but you need that drive and persistence, everybody has a different idea of success and what it means to them but there is often a misconception that simply being smart is the easiest way to success, to succeed you will need to take risks and make mistakes, you have to do the unconventional<br/>
------------------------------------------------------------<br/>
<b>The Obstacle<br/>
<br/>
</b>--&gt;I'm learning a skill that probably others are feeling the same thing they're going to turn around but that's not me, i'm going to keep going because this is what makes a skill a topic valuable to learn because nobody is good at anything at first<br/>
---------------------------------------------------------<br/>
<b>The Dip<br/>
<br/>
</b>not everything is fit for you, you should choose smart path not hard path<br/>
---------------------------------------------------------<br/>
<b>Compound Learning<br/>
<br/>
</b>The idea comes from compound interest, the idea of compound learning is it leverages the fact that learning occurs every day in our life, we want to shift our focus from just cramming as much information as we want in a huge full day learning session into just small little chunks, The idea is to make small changes every single day<br/>
<br/>
--&gt;Improve by 1% a day, and in 70 days you're twice as good<br/>
----------------------------------------------------------<br/>
<b>Failures Don't Count<br/>
<br/>
</b>--&gt;They don't care about the test you failed 5 years ago, They don't care about the fact you embarrass yourself at a party 10 years ago, they only know you as your current state right now, you can be successful just 1% of the time<br/>
----------------------------------------------------------<br/>
<b>Choice VS Chore<br/>
<br/>
</b>--&gt;it's a choice not a chore to do something, when you have to think to yourself i need to go exercise and this feels like a chore, long term you're not going to keep exercising because it's like washing dishes or doing laundry<br/>
----------------------------------------------------------<br/>
<b>It's All in the frame<br/>
<br/>
</b><b>Framing</b>--&gt;is an important concept when it comes to learning because almost nothing in this world is objective most things are subjective<br/>
<br/>
--&gt;Almost everything in this world has different contexts or different frames that you can use to view things in a different way<br/>
----------------------------------------------------------<br/>
<b>Pareto Principle<br/>
<br/>
</b>--&gt;also known as the 80/20 rule, it's the idea that roughly 80% of the results usually comes from 20% of the causes or inputs<br/>
<br/>
ex:<br/>
80% of sales comes from 20% of clients<br/>
80% of code comes from 20% of the programmers<br/>
<br/>
--&gt;The closer we get to 100% mastery the longer and longer it takes but usually the initial 80% can be achieved quite fast and this principle is what we're doing<br/>
----------------------------------------------------------<br/>
<b>Skill Stacking<br/>
<br/>
</b>--&gt;Three approaches when it comes to career strategy:<br/>
<br/>
1-Curiosity<br/>
2-Value learning(choosing the opportunity that allows you to learn the best such as accepting a job because you're going to be surrounded by people way smarter than you)<br/>
3-combining skills to create a little niche for you(ex: if you're a programmer and you combine that with business skills or communication skills that's going to make you more valuable)<br/>
----------------------------------------------------------<br/>
<b>Happiness Factors<br/>
<br/>
</b><b>--&gt;</b>To enjoy what you're doing to enjoy growing and learning you need to be happy<br/>
<br/>
<b>Factors:<br/>
<br/>
</b>1-Friends<br/>
2-Learning and growth<br/>
3-Health and fitness<br/>
----------------------------------------------------------<br/>
<b>Self Learning Paradigm<br/>
<br/>
</b>--&gt;The idea of the self learning paradigm is that you need that intrinsic motivation, you need to from inside of yourself decide that this is why you want to do<b><br/>
