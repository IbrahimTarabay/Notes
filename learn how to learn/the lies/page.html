<title>The Lies</title>
</head><body><b>Follow Your Passion<br/>
<br/>
</b>--&gt;This advice is often not a good advice, Because you like doing something like travel or chess doesn't mean that's what work career needs to be <br/>
<br/>
--&gt;Many people who actually love what they do don't have a passion for it<br/>
<br/>
--&gt;i am not really passionate about programming but i enjoy the process of getting better and better and the more success i had in my career the more i enjoyed it the more i became passionate about the topic<br/>
<br/>
--&gt;All you need is a little bit of interest in a topic and once you have that little bit of interest then by learning and improving over and over it becomes more and more enjoyable because you go from a beginner<br/>
<br/>
--&gt;Craftsman mindset asks how can i improve and have something valuable to the world<br/>
<br/>
--&gt;work hard put your head down learn a valuable skills combine different skills and get really good that they can't ignore you<br/>

<b>You Can Avoid Risk<br/>
<br/>
</b>--&gt;lie that you can avoid risk when you becoming expert in a field, Risk is part of the process to really achieve anything worthwhile, you have to be able to tolerate and enjoy taking risks enjoy those butterflies that you get in your stomach when you're doing something that you're not comfortable with<br/>
---------------------------------------------------------<br/>
<b>Trust This One Person<br/>
<br/>
</b>--&gt;Trust this one person why is this a bad advice??<br/>
--&gt;Becaue we tend to always look up as humans to leaders<br/>
<br/>
--&gt;each person gives advice based on things that worked in their life their experiences which are unique to them <br/>
<br/>
--&gt;You will often find that people who have really strong hard opinions on something are often the people who are less knowledgeable <br/>
<br/>
--&gt;The people who tell you that they know everything are often the ones that know the least<br/>

<b>10000 Hours Rule<br/>
<br/>
</b>--&gt;What's the difference between the top masters and the good ones?<br/>
<br/>
--&gt;The answer was simple just practice more the more you practice the better you get, As humans this was a nice concept to understand because the idea if you put 10000 hours into a skill then you become a master of it, <b>it wasn't really accurate</b>, there are other parameters like friends,genes, history<br/>
