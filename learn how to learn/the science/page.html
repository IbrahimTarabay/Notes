<title>The Science</title>
</head><body><b>Focus VS Diffuse Mode<br/>
<br/>
</b>--&gt;Back and forth from focus to diffuse mode is what actually creates efficient learning<br/>
<br/>
--&gt;so by going back and forth from focus to diffuse allows our brains to grow and build our brain like a muscle<br/>
------------------------------------------------------------<br/>
<b>The Science of sleep<br/>
<br/>
</b>--&gt;if you're not sleeping well you're automatically at a disadvantage comapred to everybody else<br/>
------------------------------------------------------------<br/>
<b>Brain Training<br/>
<br/>
</b>--&gt;everytime you learn connections are being created in your brain, when you're not exercising your mind your mind actually loses neurons but when we use our brain when we learn new things neurons become linked together through repeated use, so practice creates stronger and stronger connections<br/>
<br/>
--&gt;if you don't use it we're going to lose it<br/>
---------------------------------------------------------<br/>
<b>The Science of feedback<br/>
<br/>
</b>--&gt;instead of just getting compliments, you're so good at this you're so good at that by getting negative feedback you know exactly what to fix or what people don't like, so negative feedback actually appears significally more effective for learning especially when you're at high level<br/>
<br/>
--&gt;when you have positive feedback at the very beginning it gets you over those obstacles at the beginning<br/>
<br/>
--&gt;you can train to become a professional basketball player by yourself at home but the person who gets a coach and gets feedback will outpace the first person very fast<br/>
---------------------------------------------------------<br/>
<b>Procrastination<br/>
<br/>
</b>--&gt;idea of putting off something because you don't fell like doing it right now<br/>
<br/>
--&gt;When you learn something new it activates an area of the brain associated with pain with negativity<br/>
<br/>
--&gt;Procrastination is an issue with managing our emotion not our time<br/>
<br/>
--&gt;research has found that in order to get ride of procrastination you just need to take the initiative and doing the task<br/>
<br/>
--&gt;You need to realize that you're make a sacrifice of short term positivity versus long term positivity, it's delayed gratification<br/>
<br/>
--&gt;The people who read the sad stories were more likely to procrastinate to solve puzzle than those that didn't why is that because they were looking for something positive to change their negative emotions<br/>
<br/>
--&gt;so you need to be happy if you want to avoid procrastination<br/>
---------------------------------------------------------<br/>
<b>Long and Short Memory<br/>
<br/>
</b>--&gt;Long term memory is formed by practicing and repeating, long term memory is extremely important when it comes to knowledge and learning because that where you put fundamental concepts and principles that guide your life<br/>
<br/>
--&gt;You want to move this short term memory to long term memory that's how long term memory form, you can do this using a technique called spaced repetition, repeat something 20 times in one day is not as good as repeat something 20 times over 20 days<br/>
---------------------------------------------------------<br/>
<b>Active vs Passive learning<br/>
<br/>
</b>--&gt;listening to podcasts watching youtube videos watching other people demonstrate things is passive learning <br/>
<br/>
--&gt;Active learning involves being involved practicing and actually taking down notes trying to solve problems yourself<br/>
<br/>
--&gt;one hour of study versus one hour of test are two different things the test is actually better for your learning<br/>
---------------------------------------------------------<br/>
<b>The Science of Motivation<br/>
<br/>
</b><b>intrinsic motivation</b>--&gt;motivation that comes from the inside<br/>
<br/>
<b>External motivation</b>--&gt;things like money like salary like gifts<br/>
<br/>
--&gt;Researchers actually found that when something like money or prizes which are external rewards are given for actions that people actually find intrinsically motivated or intrinsically rewarding become less to pursue those activities in the future<br/>
---------------------------------------------------------<br/>
<b>Goals<br/>
<br/>
</b>--&gt;without goals we don't know where we're going<br/>
<br/>
--&gt;The larger the change we want to make the more scared we become and that's actually part of our brain<br/>
<br/>
--&gt;The idea is to take small steps towards a goal in this way we avoid triggering the amygdala's fear detection system, the smaller the steps we take the easier it becomes for us to create those neural networks in our brain and create positive habits<br/>
<br/>
SMART GOALS<br/>
<br/>
<b>S</b>--&gt;Specific<br/>
<b>M</b>--&gt;Measurable<br/>
<b>A</b>--&gt;Achievable<br/>
<b>R</b>--&gt;Relevant<br/>
<b>T</b>--&gt;Time-bound<br/>
---------------------------------------------------------<br/>
<b>It Pays to not be busy<br/>
<br/>
</b>--&gt;you want to be surrounded by other people who are stimulating you<br/>
<br/>
--&gt;being busy being always doing things and not taking breaks is actually a bad long term strategy, taking breaks in the long run will actually make you more successful<br/>
---------------------------------------------------------<br/>
<b>Chunking<br/>
<br/>
</b>--&gt;if you want to become a rocket engineer you need to form different chunks of knowledge and combine them to actually learn how everything works together<br/>
<br/>
--&gt;start with the chunks of chunking different piece of knowledge then look at the top down how do all these chunks connect and let your brain work towards connecting these chunks<br/>
