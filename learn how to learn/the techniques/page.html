<title>The Techniques</title>
</head><body><b>Pomodoro Technique<br/>
<br/>
</b>--&gt;time of focus mode of thinking or focusing on a task then 5 or 10 minutes break<br/>
<br/>
--&gt;The idea of just starting pmodoro technique is one of the best ways to get rid of procrastination<br/>
<br/>
--&gt;start with the hardest tasks<br/>
------------------------------------------------------------<br/>
<b>Chunk the Subject<br/>
<br/>
</b>--&gt;you can create great companies like Elon Musk, remember it took years and years of work many chunked knowledges, it's all about starting today forming those chunks and eventually that knowledge will compound<br/>
------------------------------------------------------------<br/>
<b>Spaced Repetition Revisited<br/>
<br/>
</b>--&gt;Spaced repetition is a proven technique in the sciences to help with learning<br/>
<br/>
Overlearning = not good<br/>
---------------------------------------------------------<br/>
<b>Deliberate Practice<br/>
<br/>
</b>--&gt;it's about doing things that are hard, the idea is we avoid easy stuff then we want take on challenging projects<br/>
---------------------------------------------------------<br/>
<b>Creating A Roadmap<br/>
<br/>
</b>--&gt;You want to know what path you need to take in order to get to where you want to be<br/>
<br/>
--&gt;You want to recognize quality resources because we live in world right now where there's information everywhere<br/>
<br/>
--&gt;By having a plan you won't get overwhelmed by the things you need to learn because humans are notorious at overestimating what we can do in the short term but underestimating what we can do in the longterm<br/>
<br/>
--&gt;we always miss deadlines because we think we can get things done faster<br/>
<br/>
--&gt;<b>When creating roadmap you want to focus on what topic is the most important</b><br/>
---------------------------------------------------------<br/>
<b>Interleaving<br/>
<br/>
</b>--&gt;The idea of interleaving instead of practicing one specific skill over and over you want to shift between three or more different skills<br/>
<br/>
--&gt;if you want to be a professional baseball player try hitting different types of pitches<br/>
<br/>
--&gt;if you want to learn a new language practice that language not just writing things down but maybe speaking<br/>
---------------------------------------------------------<br/>
<b>Einstellung<br/>
<br/>
</b>--&gt;a rigid mindest--&gt;mean we aren't too willing to see novel or different or new ideas, it's almost like a mind's way of creating a roadblock where your intuition actually becomes wrong<br/>
<br/>
--&gt;You can become a master of a topic but often what happens is that because you consider yourself no longer a beginner you stop taking advice opinions and feedback from other people from other masters or colleagues or even people that are not as smart as you<br/>
<br/>
How to solve this problem??<br/>
<br/>
--&gt;<b>integrative complexity</b>--&gt;is this idea of willingness to accept multiple perspectives<br/>
<br/>
--&gt;stronger people that have strong opinions are usually those that don't know enough<br/>
<br/>
What is option C?<br/>
<br/>
--&gt;Strong opinions are usually covering insecurities<br/>
---------------------------------------------------------<br/>
<b>Importance of Community<br/>
<br/>
</b>1-you may don't know things you will learn from others<br/>
2-you get immediate feedback<br/>
3-you can get motivated<br/>
<br/>
--&gt;You the average of five people you hang out them the most so be surrounded by people that you want to be like don't surrounded by people that drag you down<br/>
--------------------------------------------------------<br/>
<b>Habits Revisited<br/>
<br/>
</b>--&gt;Habits are energy savers of our brain<br/>
<br/>
<b>Cue--&gt;Routine--&gt;Reward<br/>
<br/>
</b>--&gt;Habits have the power because you actually believe in them you believe that it gives you a reward<br/>
<br/>
--&gt;willpower is actually a terrible strategy to get you to a goal to get you to be an efficient learner instead <b>Habits are actually a better strategy</b>&nbsp;<b>They're energy savers</b><br/>
<br/>
<b>Four laws of behavior change:<br/>
<br/>
</b>1-is there a roadmap is there a clear goal that you want to accomplish<br/>
<br/>
2-it has to be easy<br/>
<br/>
3-the outcome of this habit attractive to us does it make us feel good<br/>
<br/>
4-Does this habit reward us<br/>
<br/>
--&gt;Don't break the cahin (ex github day to day green square commit light)<br/>
--------------------------------------------------------<br/>
<b>System vs Goals<br/>
<br/>
</b>--&gt;we need to have a clear defined SMART goals, <b>goals are good but systems are even better<br/>
</b><b><br/>
</b>Success = Luck x Skills that you obtain<br/>
<br/>
--&gt;if you're an efficient learner you're not guaranteed success luck still plays a role in our lives but we have control over the skills that we obtain<br/>
<br/>
--&gt;so by having a system instead of a goal we actually can incorporate this luck side of the equation<br/>
<br/>
examples:<br/>
1- i need to study 6 hours a day this is system<br/>
<br/>
2-i need to finish this project after month this is a goal<br/>
<br/>
--&gt;by creating a system instead of a goal we think about the small chunks of time that we need so that we do things each day that have long term effects<br/>
<br/>
--&gt;if you find yourself being the type of person that doesn't accomplish their goals of finds procrastination easy then systems and processes is what you need<br/>
<br/>
--&gt;Systems eventually become into habits<br/>
<br/>
--&gt;Goals are really good for short and simple small tasks things that you can usually do in a day but if you want to accomplish something over your life instead of a goal have a system.<br/>
--------------------------------------------------------<br/>
<b>The Power of the senses<br/>
<br/>
</b>--&gt;As humans metaphors and analogies and visualizations stories are important<br/>
<br/>
--&gt;adding an emotional element to your studies hooks in even more neurons to strengthen those memories<br/>
<br/>
--&gt;You can seek out new experiences outside of learning to stimulate your brain you can learn in places that stimulate your senses like coffe shop-fire-garden<br/>
<br/>
--&gt;if you're learning in your bedroom on your bed where you spend every single night that's not stimulating that not exciting<br/>
--------------------------------------------------------<br/>
<b>Pareto Principle Revisted<br/>
<br/>
</b>--&gt;What critical skills are for you to get results as fast as possible<br/>
<br/>
--&gt;The key is to remove the noise remove the things that aren't of the highest quality<br/>
--------------------------------------------------------<br/>
<b>Parkinson's law<br/>
<br/>
</b>--&gt;by using small little systems and goals with specific deadlines<br/>
--------------------------------------------------------<br/>
<b>Deep Work<br/>
<br/>
</b>--&gt;is a period of intense focus that hard and important intellectual work that we do during long uninterrupted periods of time, it's period where you have no distractions you're concentrated on a task and you push your cognitive abilities to their limit<br/>
<br/>
1-make sure that i have a dedicated workspace<br/>
<br/>
2-What time is my focused deep work going to end<br/>
<br/>
3-Make sure that all my power ups like did i sleep well is my brain well rested did i exercise am i happy with other parts of my life<br/>
<br/>
4-form habit of me learning<br/>
<br/>
5-delibrate practice<br/>
--------------------------------------------------------<br/>
<b>Stakes and Reward<br/>
<br/>
</b>--&gt;is to focus on small rewards because it feels good to be good<br/>
<br/>
--&gt;if we didn't care about money if we didn't care about relationships then we wouldn't get anything accomplished<br/>
--------------------------------------------------------<br/>
<b>Concepts vs Facts<br/>
<br/>
</b>--&gt;Concepts are more important than facts<br/>
<br/>
--&gt;facts are easy to Google, concepts on other hand are hard to google for sometimes<br/>
<br/>
--&gt;Concepts are valuable facts are cheap because anybody can learn facts<br/>
--------------------------------------------------------<br/>
<b>Test Yourself<br/>
<br/>
</b>--&gt;without practice you're never going to get anywhere<br/>
<br/>
--&gt;You can watch all the soccer videos in the world you're not going to be a professional soccer player<br/>
<br/>
--&gt;You have to do the uncomfortable and the uncomfortable to test yourself and fail many times and learn from your mistakes<br/>
---------------------------------------------------------<br/>
<b>The First 20 Hours<br/>
<br/>
</b>1-creating learning map<br/>
2-test our selfs and have active learning<br/>
3-over learning(we are aginst this point)<br/>
4-good feedback system<br/>
