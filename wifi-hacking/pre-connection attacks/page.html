#airodump-ng wlan0 (discovering all wireless networks)<br/>
<br/>
<b>BSSID: </b>The MAC address of the target network<br/>
<b>PWR: </b>Signal Power of the network, the higher value the better signal we have so -52 better than -58<br/>
<b>Beacons: </b>These are frames sent by the network in order to broadcast its existence, so every network even if it's set to be hidden always sends these type of frames basically broadcast<br/>
<b>#Data:</b>These are the useful packets<br/>
<b>#/s: </b>number of data packets that we collected<br/>
<b>CH:</b>channel that the network works on<br/>
<b>MB:</b>Maximum speed supported by the network<br/>
<b>ENC:</b>The Encryption used by the network<br/>
<b>CIPHER:</b>is the cipher used in the network<br/>
<b>AUTH: </b>authentication<br/>
<br/>
<b>Targeted Packet Sniffing:</b><br/>
#airodump-ng --bssid 58:7F:66:3F:61:E0 --channel 9 --write test wlan0<br/>
<br/>
--&gt;<b>test-01.cap: </b>this file contains the data that we captured during the period that airodump was working, it should contain URLs, chat messages, usernames, passwords, WPA2 is the only problem because it's encrypt these packets<br/>
<br/>
<b>Deauthentication Attack:<br/>
<br/>
</b><b>--&gt;</b>Disconnect any client from any network<br/>
<b>USE:</b><br/>
aireplay-ng --deauth 100000000 -a 58:7F:66:3F:61:E0 -c 54:35:30:8A:C9:DB wlan0<br/>
(100000000 these are packets that will keep sending to router and the target device therefore i'll disconnect my target device for a very long period of time)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<b>if we want to change the mac address:<br/>
<br/>
</b>#ifconfig wlan0 down (to disable network adapter)<br/>
#ifconfig wlan0 hw ether 00:11:22:33:44:55 (change to this mac address)<br/>
#ifconfig wlan0 up (to enable adapter again)<br/>

EXPLANATION<br/>
</b><br/>
<b>Packet Sniffing:<br/>
</b><br/>
USING AIRODUMP-NG<br/>
<br/>
--&gt;Part of the aircrack-ng suit<br/>
--&gt;Airodump-ng is a packet sniffer<br/>
--&gt;Used to capture all packets within range<br/>
--&gt;Display detailed info about networks around us<br/>
--&gt;Connected clients....etc<br/>
<br/>
use:<br/>
airodump-ng[MonitorModeInterface]<br/>
<br/>
<b>Deauthentication Attack:<br/>
<br/>
</b><b>--&gt;</b>Disconnect any client from any network<br/>
 -Works on encrypted netwroks(WEP,WPA&amp;WPA2)<br/>
 -No need to know the network key<br/>
 -No need to connect to the network<br/>
<br/>
<b>USE:</b><br/>
aireplay-ng --deauth [#DeauthPackets] -a [NetworkMac] -c [TargetMac] [Interface]<br/>
<br/>
Deauthentication Attack: it's very useful in social engineering cases where you could disconnect clients from the target network and then call the user and pretend to be a person from the IT department and ask them to install a virus or a backdoor telling them that this would fix their issue, you could also create a fake access point(router) and get them to connect to it<br/>
