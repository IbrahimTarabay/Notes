</head><body><b>Wireshark:<br/>
<br/>
</b>-Wireshark is a network protocol analyser<br/>
-Designed to help network administrators to keep track of what is happening in their network<br/>
<br/>
<b>How does it work?<br/>
<br/>
</b>-Logs packets that flow through the selected interface<br/>
-Analyse all the packets<br/>
<br/>
--&gt;when we are the MITM, Wireshark can be used to sniff&amp;analyse traffic sent/received by targets<br/>
<br/>
Wireshark--&gt;isn't a hack tool, it's not going to capture things happening in another device, it only capture things that flow through your own interface<br/>
<br/>
note: when we are MITM all the packets that's generated by the target has been redirected to my own computer</body></html>
